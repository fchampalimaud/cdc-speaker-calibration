# Speaker Calibration Protocol

This is the documentation for the Python code used in the speaker calibration protocol.

The code written for this project was inspired by the MATLAB version of the protocol. The MATLAB code can be found in the `matlab` folder of the project's repository, in which the main file is `Calibrate.m`.

Additionally, a protocol for latency measurements in the Harp SoundCard can be found [here](latency.md).
