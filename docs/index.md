# Speaker Calibration Protocol

This is the documentation for the Python code used in the speaker calibration protocol.

The code written for this project was inspired by a MATLAB version of a similar setup written by Juan Castiñeiras. The MATLAB code can be found in the `matlab` folder of the project's repository, in which the main file is `Calibrate.m`.

Additionally, a protocol for latency measurements in the Harp SoundCard can be found [here](latency.md).
