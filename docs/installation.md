# Installation
For now, the setup was only tested in Windows and it still has some rough edges. The limitations for the remaining operating systems are unknown.

## Prerequisites
- Install the firmware for the Harp SoundCard (follow the instructions in the [device's repository](https://github.com/harp-tech/device.soundcard)). It is recommended that the Harp SoundCard GUI is installed (although it is not absolutely necessary).
- Install the [NI-DAQ driver](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html#532710).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository (or download it for non-git users).
2. Run `setup.cmd`.
